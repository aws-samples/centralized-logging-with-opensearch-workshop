# Internal FAQ

### Will the solution support self-hosted Elasticsearch domain in the future?
There is no clear answer for this question yet. We have heard from customers that the AOS price is too high comparing 
to self-hosted Elasticsearch domain. Because of this, we have added this feature in our backlog. However, we need more 
information to prioritize our backlogs. Currently, it is in low priority.
