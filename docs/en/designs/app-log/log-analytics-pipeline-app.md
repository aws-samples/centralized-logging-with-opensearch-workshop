# Application Log

A Log Pipeline includes the process of receiving, cleaning, enhancing, and writing data to AOS. Typically, a log pipeline only accepts logs in one format.
A log analytics pipeline corresponds to an index pattern in AOS (e.g. `log-hub-nginx-log-index`)ã€‚

## Concept

### Log Config

Log Config contains

- Config Name: The name of the log configuration, the name must be unique, and can only contains lower case letters and -.

- Log Path: Specify the log file locations. If you have multiple locations, please write all the locations and split using ' , '. e.g./var/log/app1/_.log,/var/log/app2/_.log. All files in the specified folder that match the file name will be monitored. The file name can be a full name or wildcard pattern matching is supported.

- Log Type: the Log Hub has built-in plugins to parse log data from log agents. Currently supported log types are as follows:

  - JSON, Nginx Log, Apache Log, Spring Boot Log

  - Additionally, we also point to custom parsing via regular expressions

- Log Format: the log format configuration in Nginx, Spring Boot, Apache configuration files. Such as Nginx, if you want to know more, you can refer to [configuring logging in Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/)

### Log Group

A Log Group is a collection of one or more Log Configs applied to a group of EC2 instances. The following figure can better understand the concepts of Log Group and Log Config.

According to the configuration shown in the figure above, the configuration files of FluentBit in Instance A, B, and C are all different.

- Instance A: Collect Nginx type log a and JSON format log b.
- Instance B: Collect all four types of logs.
- Instance C: Collect Apache type logs c and JSON format logs d.

## FAQ

Q. Why not use Firehose to collect and write to AOS?

Because the minimum buffer interval of Firehose is 60s, it is difficult to meet the scene of real-time class analysis. Please refer to [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html).
